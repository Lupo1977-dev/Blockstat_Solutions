# This project contains an example of a liquidity provider bot for Orca DEX

# Orca is a DEX on Solana chain

# The following files 011_xxxx to 081_xxx are examples of typescript files from the

# developer documents of the Orca DEX. I have edited these files myself to run with my own wallets

# Next I have used all these files to construct a script that automatically creates a LP position at the Orca DEX.

# The following file will create a NEW LP position (concentrated liquidity V3) on Orca

"open_position_solana_bot_1.ts"

# The following file will close an existing LP position (concentrated liquidity V3) on Orca

"close_position_solana_bot_1.ts"
