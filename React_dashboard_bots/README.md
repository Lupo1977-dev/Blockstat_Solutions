# React + Vite

# This project creates a website for all the relevant information from my liquidity provider positions on Pancakeswap.

# I run several liquidity provider positions on Orca, Pancakeswap and Uniswap (see other project folders for more infomation).

# The 'src' folder contains all the React files for the front-end

# The 'server' folder contains all the NodeJS files for the back-end. Here, we gather all relevent information from the blockchain for several LP positions

# and send it to the front-end so that users can observe in real time how the LP positions are performing (current value, pending fees etc etc).
