I'm a Blockchain and DeFi enthusiast with a deep passion for crypto and blockchain technology, a journey that began in July 2017. 
Since January 2023, I've been professionally developing blockchain projects, specializing in JavaScript, Solidity, and creating Decentralized Applications (DApps).
I've added five of my recent projects here on GitHub. 
Feel free to explore my work, and don't hesitate to connect if you're interested in collaborating or just want to chat about all things blockchain!
