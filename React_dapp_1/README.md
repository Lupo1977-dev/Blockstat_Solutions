# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
After that I have edited myself in order to build a simple Dapp.
I deployed a new token wDripMax on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC)
The website allows you to connect to a Metamask wallet and call several Solidity functions from the smart contract,
such as approving, minting and redeeming. And there is also a function to read all relevant information (current price, users etc.) about this token
from the blockchain.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
